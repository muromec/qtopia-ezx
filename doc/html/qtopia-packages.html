<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Qtopia is available in a number of different editions and packages. The available editions include:</p>
<p><table width="100%" align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" border="0">
<thead><tr valign="top" class="qt-style"><th>Edition</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td>Qtopia Platform Edition</td><td>Includes all functionality forming the platform upon which Qtopia applications are built and provides a base for target devices that are different to those specifically targeted by the other editions. Qtopia Platform Edition is issued under a commercial license.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="even"><td>Qtopia Phone Edition</td><td>Includes Qtopia Platform functionality together with many phone-specific applications. Qtopia Phone Edition is issued under a commercial license.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="odd"><td>Qtopia Opensource Edition</td><td>Identical to Qtopia Phone Edition, but issued under the GNU General Public License version 2, which does not permit closed-source commercial development.</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> For a complete list of applications please refer to <a href="qtopia-components.html">Qtopia Components</a>.</p>
<p>The commercial Qtopia editions target companies involved in commercial Qtopia application development, including those requiring support and maintenance. The Opensource edition targets opensource developers, who will release the source code of their Qtopia applications and any changes they make to Qtopia itself. Trolltech does not provide support and maintenance for the Opensource edition.</p>
<a name="qtopia-source-packages"></a>
<h2>Qtopia Source Packages</h2>
<p>Each Qtopia edition is released as a source code package (also referred to as an <b>OEM Kit</b>). These packages allow customers to customize Qtopia to work on their particular device, to install and distribute Qtopia on devices, and allow customers to develop their own Qtopia applications.</p>
<p>To install and distribute Qtopia on commercial devices both the Qtopia OEM Kit and <a href="qtopia-licensing.html">Qtopia Runtime</a> licenses are required.</p>
<a name="qtopia-software-development-kit-sdk"></a>
<h2>Qtopia Software Development Kit (SDK)</h2>
<p>The Qtopia SDK enables the development of Qtopia applications.</p>
<p>The SDK contains a complete Software Development environment that can be installed and executed on both Linux and Windows. Within the environment Qtopia based applications can be developed, compiled, and debugged and then installed onto a device such as the Greenphone.</p>
<p>The SDK is provided in binary format and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>pre-built binaries for i386 and ARM</li>
<li>header files to allow customers to build and link Qtopia-based applications</li>
<li>documentation</li>
<li>tools required for the production of Qtopia-based applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>To simplify debugging of Qtopia itself, the user can install and build a Qtopia source package inside the SDK.</p>
<a name="commercial-licensing"></a>
<h2>Commercial Licensing</h2>
<p>Commercial, proprietary and non-free software may only be written if one of the commercial editions of Qtopia has been purchased. Various <a href="qtopia-licensing.html">licenses</a> and license agreements are available to suit the development and distribution needs of customers. If <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/documents/whyfs.en">free software</a> is going to be developed for release using a recognized open source license then the Qtopia Opensource Edition should be used.</p>
<p>The purchase of a Qtopia commercial edition includes technical support and upgrades.</p>
<a name="opensource-licensing"></a>
<h2>Opensource Licensing</h2>
<p>Free software comes with a license providing certain rights to users. In particular the rights to use the software, modify it, obtain its source, and to pass it on under the same terms. In this context the the term &quot;free&quot; is about rights, not money.</p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation (creators of the GNU GPL) refer to free in the sense of <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/documents/whyfs.en">freedom not price </a>.</p>
<p>Trolltech supports the free software concept by providing the Qtopia Opensource Edition. You can use this edition of Qtopia to create free software, i.e&#x2e; software that is licensed under the GNU GPL or a similarly recognized open source license.</p>
<p>This version of Qtopia is provided with no support and no warranty. It is provided under the GNU General Public License, GPL.</p>
<a name="online-availability"></a>
<h3>Online Availability</h3>
<p>The Qtopia Opensource Edition can be downloaded from: http//www.qtextended.org.</p>
<a name="licensing-conditions"></a>
<h3>Licensing Conditions</h3>
<p>If you use the Qtopia Free Edition, there are licensing conditions that the GNU GPL imposes to ensure that your users enjoy the freedoms guaranteed by the GPL. Users are entitled to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run your software for any purpose.</li>
<li>Obtain and study your software's source code, and adapt it to their needs.</li>
<li>Redistribute your software and its source code to others under the same terms.</li>
<li>Improve or modify your software, and release these changes to the public.</li>
</ul>
<p>These freedoms apply to all source code for all the modules your software is based on, regardless of whether they have been written by you or by others. The freedoms also apply to any associated interface definition files and include the scripts and control files used to control compilation and installation of the executable. This last freedom is necessary to ensure that users can exercise their rights.</p>
<p>This means the Qtopia Free Edition cannot be used to develop software that will incorporate modules imposing conditions contradicting those of the GNU GPL. The GNU GPL conditions relate to, but are not limited to, software patents, commercial license agreements, copyrighted interface definitions and any sort of non-disclosure agreements. If your software is going to conflict with any of these conditions then the Qtopia Free Edition is not appropriate and you must use one of the commercial editions of Qtopia.</p>
