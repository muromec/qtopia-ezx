Building Qtopia for the Neo

1. Downloading Qtopia

Download the Qtopia 4.3 open source package (qtopia-opensource-src-4.3.0.tar.gz).

	tar xvfz qtopia-opensource-src-4.3.0.tar.gz
	cd qtopia-opensource-4.3.0
	export QPEDIR=$PWD

The device specific information can be found in $QPEDIR/devices/ficgta01.

2. Build instructions

In order to build Qtopia for the Neo various tools and file systems provided by 
OpenEmbedded are needed. For more information about OpenEmbedded refer to 
http://www.openembedded.org . There are two ways how a Qtopia flash image for the Neo 
can be created. 

2.1 Building from scratch using OpenEmbedded

This option should be used to build the required rootfs, toolchains and Qtopia using 
the OpenEmbedded build system. It will build the entire distribution from scratch.
To simplify the process $QPEDIR/devices/ficgta01/oe/ contains a local overlay for 
OpenEmbedded. It will download, setup and build OpenEmbedded and Qtopia, depending 
on changes to OpenEmbedded itself. For more details on how to use overlays refer 
to the OpenEmbedded webpage.

2.2 Building Qtopia only

Trolltech provides a root file system and toolchain which are already prepared for 
Qtopia. They can be downloaded from QtExtended.org Choosing this option will 
significantly reduce the amount of work necessary. However this step also assumes 
that the device has a working kernel already. 

The first step is to unpack the downloaded toolchain into /opt/toolchains/arm920t-eabi. 
Qtopia's build system will automatically pick it up and use it for cross compilation. 
If the toolchain is located in a different directory the script
 $QPEDIR/devices/ficgta01/environment must be edited to reflect the new path.

Configure Qtopia, confirm license and build Qtopia for the via the following steps:

	cd $QPEDIR
	./configure -device ficgta01
	make
	make install

The result of the build process can be found in $QPEDIR/image.

Unpack the download rootfs:

	cd $QPEDIR
	mkdir rootfs
	sudo tar -C rootfs -xvpzf ../ficgta01-baserootfs-gnueabi.tgz

Add the Qtopia build to the rootfs:

	sudo cp -a ~/build/fic/image/* rootfs/opt/Qtopia

and finally, create the jffs2 file system:

	sudo mkfs.jffs2 --pad=0x700000 -v -o ficgta01-qtopia-rootfs.jffs2 -e 0x4000 -n -drootfs


3. Flashing the device

Flashing the Neo requires the dfu-tool utility. More information about this tool can be 
found under http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Dfu-util.


Detailed instructions on how to flash the device can be found on the Openmoko Wiki 
(http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Flashing_openmoko#Actually_flashing_things_into_the_device).


Hold the AUX button and power on to get to the boot menu (hold power button for a good 
long 5 seconds) and then plug in the USB.

You might also need to do:

	minicom /dev/ttyACM0
 	nand erase rootfs

To flash a kernel: 

	sudo dfu-util -a 3 -R -D <image>

To flash the rootfs such as the one created in step 2.2 (see above): 

 	sudo dfu-util -a 5 -R -D ficgta01-qtopia-rootfs.jffs2
