<h1>Build System Installation</h1>
<hr>

<p>The build system exists in the /ribsome/build on Helixcommunity.  This is
the Python code only.  It also requires a Python interpreter, and a compiler
at minimum.  Other tools are required, depending on the platform.  There are
three basic platform types: <a href="#unix">UNIX</a>, <a href="#windows">Windows</a>, and <a href="#macintosh">Macintosh</a> described here.

You may also want to read these <a href="https://common.helixcommunity.org/2002/devdocs/quickstart.html">step-by-step instructions</a> for how to build the helix client.

</p>


<a name="windows">
<h3>Windows Installation</h3>
<p>The build system requirements on windows are:
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 5 or 6 with latest service packs.</li>
  <li>Python 1.5.2 or later</li>
  <li>Python Win32 extensions (optional)</li>
  <li>cvs.exe >= 1.10.5</li>
  <li>rm.exe (from GNU tools / cygwin)</li>
  <li>The ribosome build system from CVS ( from /ribosome/build ) </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Microsoft Visual C++ 5 or 6 with latest service packs:</b> Before you
install the compiler, consider changing the installation path.  By
default, it installs to <i>c:\Program Files\</i>, and the spaces in
the environment variables set by this cause problems.  If you go with
the default install location, you will need to make a few changes.
First, do not register the environment variables at the end of the
installation.  You will need to use the
<i>vc\bin\vcvars32.bat</i> script to setup your environment variables.
Second, you will need to edit the <i>vcvars32.bat</i> script and
change all the long path names to their 8.3 equivalents.  This means
<i>Program Files</i> becomes
<i>progra~1</i>.  If this doesn't make sense to you, the rules for
path  conversion are in the Windows documentation somewhere.</p>

<p>Create a batch script to set up your environment.  You will have to use
the <b>CALL</b> convention in you batch script to import the environment
variables from the <i>vcvars32.bat</i> file.  You will also want to set your
<b>CVSROOT</b>, <b>BUILD_ROOT</b>, and <b>PATH</b> inside this script.<p>

<p><b>Example Script</b>(dev.bat):
<pre>
set CVSROOT=:pserver:user@localhost:/cvs
set BUILD_ROOT=c:\dev\build
set PATH=%BUILD_ROOT%\bin;c:\cygwin\bin;c:\python21;c:\dev\bldtools\;%PATH%
call c:\progra~1\devstudio\vc\bin\vcvars32.bat
</pre>
</p>

<p>In this setup, cvs.exe is in the
<i>c:\dev\bldtools</i> directory. It also assumes that you have an ssh
tunnel running your machine which forwards your cvs port (2401) to the
approperiate remote cvs server (cvs.helixcommunity.org).

Now create a new directory for you
source code to go, and run <b>build</b>.  You will get a menu.  You
can test your setup by building the target
<b>client_core</b>.</p>

<h3>Macintosh Installation</h3>

<p>
These instructions are intended for MacOS X using a regular python
compiled for UNIX. If you wish to use MacPython with MacOS X, go
<a href="MacOS_X_Build_System.html">here</a>. If you are using MacOS
8 or 9, go <a href="macos9.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Required tools:
<ul>
  <li>MetroWerks Codewarrior 8 with latest patches</li>
  <li>Python 2.2 compiled for Unix (Already installed if you use 10.2 or later)</li>
  <li>MacCVS Pro 2.7d3</li>
  <li>Stuffit Deluxe or DropStuff and Stuffit Expander (from StuffIt Lite)</li>
  <li>The ribosome build system from CVS ( from /ribosome/build ) </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Previous versions of the Mac build system has required a file
called RMA Build Prefs to emulate environment variables. This is
no longer the case and environment variables should now be added
to your shell environment like any other Unix. An example of
how to do this and which variables are needed is <a href="macenv.txt">here</a>.
For additional information about what variables to use and how to write
pcf files for MacOS X, see <a href="MacOS_X_Build_System.html">the
MacPython build system instructions</a>.
</p>

<h3>UNIX Installation</h3>
<p>UNIX systems are relatively easy to install.  The only catch is getting the
correct compiler.  For any given UNIX configuration, look at the docstring in
its Umake configuration in build/umakecf/*.cf.  The docstring will contain
the information on what compiler is used.  Required tools:
<ul>
  <li>C/C++ Compiler</li>
  <li>GNU Make</li>
  <li>zlib</li>
  <li>Python 1.5.2 or later compiled with zlib support (modify modules/Setup.in)</li>
  <li>Motif 2/OpenMotif 2.1 (for building the client)</li>
  <li>The ribosome build system from CVS ( from /ribosome/build ) </li>
</ul>
</p>
</a>
